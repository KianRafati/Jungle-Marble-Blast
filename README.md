# Jungle-Marble-Blast
A 2d video game made with SDL2 and c++, coded by me.

With the help of SDL2_Main, SDL2_Mixer, SDL2_Image,SDL2_ttf and C++ bits/stc++.h libraries 
I developed a game similar to Zuma and Jungle Marble Blast.

This SDL2 video game features random map generation using time.h and random libraries.
It also features account management and menu settings.
